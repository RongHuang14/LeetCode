"""
Check if all brackets are valid using a stack. o(n) o(n)

- Every closing bracket must match the most recent unmatched opening bracket.
- This is a classic LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure â€” the last opened must be closed first.
  Example: s = "({[]})" is valid because each closing bracket matches the top of the stack.
- For every char in s:
  - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the stack top.
  - If it matches, pop the stack; otherwise, return False.
  - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n) for the stack
