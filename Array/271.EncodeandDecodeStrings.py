"""
Encode and decode a list of strings using length-based encoding.

Encoding Strategy:
- Each string is converted to "length#string" format.
- The "#" acts as a separator to distinguish the length from the content.
- Example: ["leet", "code"] â†’ "4#leet4#code"

Decoding Strategy:
- Read the length prefix before each "#".
- Extract the corresponding substring using the length.
- Continue parsing until the entire encoded string is processed.

Time Complexity: O(m) for encode() and decode(),
where m is the total length of all strings in strs.

Space Complexity: O(m + n), where m is the size of the encoded string
and n is the number of strings in the list.
