"""
Sliding window to find the longest substring where at most k characters can be replaced
to make all characters in the window the same.

1. Use a hashmap to count character frequencies in the current window.
2. Track maxf: the count of the most frequent character in the window.
3. If (window size - maxf) > k, it means we need to replace more than k characters,
   so we shrink the window from the left.
4. Update the maximum length of a valid window at each step.

Time: O(n) â€” each character is visited at most twice.
Space: O(1) â€” only 26 uppercase letters are stored in the map.
